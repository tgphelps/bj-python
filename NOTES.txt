After I finally got the player hand code working (as best I can tell),
I did some large simulations of various subsets of Basic Strategy, to
see the effect that the various player options has on the overall
house edge.

For all of these tests, I used these house rules, which comes directly
from data/house/cfg:

num_decks = 6
hit_s17 = 1
das_allowed = 1
max_split_hands = 4
max_split_aces = 2
can_hit_split_aces = 0
surrender_allowed = 1

(And blackjacks pay 3-2.)

I think those rules are typical of Las Vegas strip rules.

Here are the 8 different player strategies that I tested with.
After the first two, the rest of them are subsets of Basic Strategy.

1. Never bust - Never hit a hard hand that can bust, and hit all
   soft hands of 17 or less.
2. Emulate dealer - Stand on hard 17 and soft 18, else hit.
3. Basic hit hard - Handle all hands, hard or soft, according to the
   basic 'hit hard' strategy. No doubles, split pairs, or surrender.
4. Basic hit all - Handle all hands according to the basic rules for
   hitting. No doubles, split pairs, or surrender.
5. Basic double hard - Like #4, plus basic hard double rules.
6. Basic double all - Like #4, plus all basic double rules.
7. Basic splits - Full basic strategy, minus surrender.
8. Basic full - All basic strategy rules.

Here are the results:

Strategy            Million hands dealt House edge
==================  =================== ============
Never bust          40                  6.01%
Emulate dealer      30                  5.92%
Basic hit hard      60                  3.52%
Basic hit all       70                  2.62%
Basic double hard   60                  1.19%
Basic double all    80                  1.12%
Basic splits        120                 0.55%
Basic full          90                  0.52%

Notes:
1. My decision on when to stop simulating a strategy was based on when the
results after a multiple of 10 million hands had "settled down", meaning
when I doing another 10 million hands didn't change the house edge by 0.01%.
2. The biggest drop in house edge (1.43%) comes when you allow
   hard doubles.
3. Soft doubling improved the house edge by only 0.07%
4. Surrender improved the house edge by only 0.03%
